# Tool Consolidation - Problems

## 2026-02-10

- No unresolved blockers found in Task 0 scope.
- Follow-up risk: mapping semantics for a few merged singleton actions (for example `cluster_usage` and `list_templates`) should be validated during schema/handler implementation tasks.

## Task 11 (Wave 3)

- No unresolved blockers after disk/network consolidation; build and full test suite pass.
